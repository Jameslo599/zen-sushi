This is a website I built for Zen Sushi & Grill for the purpose of driving more traffic to the business and increasing online ordering. It was a pleasure working with Chef Owner Chien-Yun on this project who provided me everything I needed to make this a success.

Here is a link to my portfolio website: https://www.zensushiandgrill.com

How it's made: Tech used: HTML, CSS, Sass, Javascript, jQuery

Lessons learned: This was a great experience in learning how to build multipage websites with beautiful transitions and overlays. Also practiced how to edit the ratio of the images I use using photo editing software to get the perfect fit on the site.
