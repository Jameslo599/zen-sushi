# Zen Sushi & Grill

This is a business website I built for my family's business Zen Sushi & Grill.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, jQuery

In 2019, after launching our family restaurant, I recognized the necessity of a website to stay competitive in the local market. Despite my initial lack of knowledge in the tech industry and coding, I ventured into the world of web development to create our first website and reduce costs. As I delved into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I developed a deep passion for coding, appreciating the ability to craft a digital product from the ground up, accessible to anyone with an internet connection.

Upon visiting our website, visitors are immediately welcomed by a horizontal navbar. Positioned on the left, it features our logo and business name, while on the right, a hamburger menu opens a modal containing links for easy page navigation. An eye-catching parallax image of a delectable tuna sushi close-up serves as the background, complemented by a compelling call-to-action button for convenient online ordering.

The subsequent section offers four distinct links, each leading to a dedicated page. This not only enhances our site's organization but also contributes to its search engine optimization (SEO). Each link boasts a unique background image and overlay color, which gracefully fades on hover.

Further down the page, we've incorporated a testimonials section. This serves the dual purpose of building trust among our visitors and providing social proof of our restaurant's quality.

Additionally, our website includes a well-crafted standard contact form designed to accommodate a variety of business needs. In the same vein, we've designed a simple yet informative footer, complete with social media links and a sitemap link. This makes it a one-stop destination for accessing all essential information about our restaurant.

## Optimizations

To boost the website's loading speed, it is advantageous to optimize image resolutions for select images and minimize unnecessary JavaScript that hinders the website's rendering process. I rely on Google Tag Manager for all my business websites, which has, at times, caused substantial obstructions in rendering. I am actively addressing this issue to enhance the website's performance.

## Lessons Learned:

I found my passion for software engineering through this project. I'm thankful to have been involved in the restaurant business as I may not have discovered tech without it.
